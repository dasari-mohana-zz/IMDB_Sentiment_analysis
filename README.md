# IMDB_Sentiment_analysis


## Description:
This is a dataset for binary sentiment classification containing substantially more data than previous benchmark datasets. Provided a set of 25,000 highly polar movie reviews for training, and 25,000 for testing. There is additional unlabeled data for use as well. Raw text and already processed bag of words formats are provided. See the README file contained in the release for more details.

## Data Source:

Keras provides access to the IMDB dataset built-in. The imdb.load_data() function allows you to load the dataset in a format that is ready for use in neural network and deep learning models.

The words have been replaced by integers that indicate the ordered frequency of each word in the dataset. The sentences in each review are therefore comprised of a sequence of integers.

## Objective:

To predict determine whether a given movie review has a positive or negative sentiment.
